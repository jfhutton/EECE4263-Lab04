# Lab04

In this lab youâ€™ll create a software-plus-hardware system capable of simulating both Round Robin and Function Queue scheduling. The system will include an interactive terminal interface allowing users to define the desired type of scheduling and individual device processing times. The terminal interface will also display the simulation results. Users will press pushbuttons to simulate device service demands. The goal of this lab is to build a system that allows users to analyze the overall performance of both Round Robin and Function Queue scheduling algorithms.

Note: This assignment is to create a simulator, not an emulator. In other words, you do not need to create actual tasks or a function queue. Instead, you must accurately simulate how such schedulers would behave.

This is a two-week lab. No formal lab report is required, but you must push your final code to your GitHub project repo and demonstrate your working simulator to your instructor at the start of lab on the due date.

Enjoy!
